The CY7C425-10PC is offered in 600-mil wide and 300-mil wide packages. They are, respectively, 256, 512, 1,024, 2,048, and 4,096 words by 9-bits wide. Each FIFO memory of the CY7C425-10PC is organized such that the data is read in the same sequential order that it was written. Full and Empty flags are provided to prevent overrun and under-run. Three additional pins are also provided to facilitate unlimited expansion in width, depth, or both. The depth expansion technique steers the control signals from one device to another in parallel, thus eliminating the serial addition of propagation delays, so that throughput is not reduced. Data is steered in a similar manner.\nParametrics\nCY7C425-10PC absolute maximum ratings: (1)Storage Temperature:\u00e2\u0080\u009365\u00e2\u0084\u0083 to +150\u00e2\u0084\u0083; (2)Ambient Temperature with Power Applied: \u00e2\u0080\u009355\u00e2\u0084\u0083 to +125\u00e2\u0084\u0083; (3)Supply Voltage to Ground Potential:\u00e2\u0080\u00930.5V to +7.0V; (4)DC Voltage Applied to Outputs; (5)in High Z State:\u00e2\u0080\u00930.5V to +7.0V; (6)DC Input Voltage:\u00e2\u0080\u00930.5V to +7.0V; (7)Power Dissipation: 1.0W; (8)Output Current, into Outputs (LOW): 20mA; (9)Static Discharge Voltage: \u00ef\u00bc\u009e2000V (per MIL\u00e2\u0080\u0093STD\u00e2\u0080\u0093883, Method 3015); (10)Latch-Up Current: \u00ef\u00bc\u009e200mA.\nFeatures\nCY7C425-10PC features: (1)Asynchronous first-in first-out (FIFO) buffer memories; (2)1K x 9 (CY7C425); (3)Dual-ported RAM cell; (4)High-speed 50.0-MHz read/write independent of depth/width; (5)Low operating power: ICC = 35mA; (6)Empty and Full flags (Half Full flag in standalone); (7)TTL compatible; (8)Retransmit in standalone; (9)Expandable in width; (10)PLCC, 7x7 TQFP, SOJ, 300-mil and 600-mil DIP; (11)Pin compatible and functionally equivalent to IDT7200, IDT7201, IDT7202, IDT7203, IDT7204, AM7200, AM7201, AM7202, AM7203, and AM7204.\nDiagrams\nShowing 5 most helpful reviews on this product.\n5 Stars\n0\n4 Stars\n0\n3 Stars\n0\n2 Stars\n0\n1 Stars\n0\nWrite a Review\nNote:All information displayed is based on feedback received for this product over the past 6 months.

The monolithic chip is available in two special packages to provide a highly integrated battery backed-up memory and real time clock solution. The M48T35Y-70MH6E is a non-volatile pin and function equivalent to any JEDEC standard 32Kb x8 SRAM. The M48T35Y-70MH6E also easily fits into many ROM, EPROM, and EEPROM a socket, providing the non-volatility of PROMs without any requirement for special write timing or limitations on the number of writes that can be performed.\nParametrics\nM48T35Y-70MH6E absolute maximum ratings: (1)Ambient Operating Temperature: Grade 1:0 to 70\u00e2\u0084\u0083; Grade 6: \u00e2\u0080\u009340 to 85\u00e2\u0084\u0083; (2)Storage Temperature (Vcc Off, Oscillator Off): \u00e2\u0080\u009340 to 85\u00e2\u0084\u0083; (3)Lead Solder Temperature for 10 seconds:260\u00e2\u0084\u0083; (4) Input or Output Voltages:\u00e2\u0080\u00930.3 to 7 V; (5) Supply Voltage:\u00e2\u0080\u00930.3 to 7 V; (6) Output Current: 20mA; (7) Power Dissipation: 1 W.\nFeatures\nM48T35Y-70MH6E features: (1)integrated ultra low power SRAM, real time clock, power-fail control circuit and battery; (2) Bytewide ram-like clock access; (3) BCD coded year, month, day, date, hours, minutes and seconds; (4) frequency test output for real time clock; (5) automatic power-fail chip deselect and write protection; (6) write protect voltages:(Vpfd = power-fail deselect voltage):4.2v \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 Vpdf \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 4.5v; (7)self-contained battery and crystal in the caphat dip package; (8) snaphat housing (battery and crystal) is replaceable; (9) pin and function compatible with JEDEC standard 32kb x8 srams.\nDiagrams\nShowing 5 most helpful reviews on this product.\n5 Stars\n0\n4 Stars\n0\n3 Stars\n0\n2 Stars\n0\n1 Stars\n0\nWrite a Review\nNote:All information displayed is based on feedback received for this product over the past 6 months.
